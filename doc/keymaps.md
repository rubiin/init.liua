# Keymaps

Few Keymaps and commands to make your life easier.Some maybe redundant but I use
them all the time.

> Note: Few keymaps may be for this config only.

Vim motions:
(left) h
(down) j
(up) k
(right) l
next word e
Jump to the first line gg
Jump to the last line G

$ move to end of line
0 move to beginning of line

Top lazyvim key bindings:

Leader + e = open nerd tree
S = Leap
Leader + ff or Leader + Leader = find files
Leader + sw = find word
Leader + [b = previous buffer
Leader + ]b = next buffer
Leader + bd = kill buffer
Leader + | = vertical split (same as tmux)
Leader + \_ = Horizontal split
Leader + ft = terminal
Leader + sB = open file browser
/ or ? = search buffer
Leader + ww = jump between neotree and bufferline

== is for selecting everything on buffer
ctrl + u for scrolling up
ctrl + d for scrolling down

Use zo or zc for single folds.

press d in tree to delete a file in neotree
press a to create a file
pres ? for help
